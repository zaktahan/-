This folder contains two advanced digital signal processing projects from the DSP II course (Bar-Ilan University). Each subfolder represents a separate exercise focused on different aspects of audio signal processing.

Project Structure

Exercise 1 – Audio Resampling

Custom implementation of signal resampling using polyphase filtering.

Comparison between L-normalized, M-normalized, and MATLAB’s built-in resample function.

Includes FFT-based spectral analysis and audio playback of original and resampled signals.

[Subfolder README provides detailed instructions for usage.]

Exercise 2 – Short-Time Fourier Transform & Time-Varying Filtering

Implementation of STFT and ISTFT for time-frequency analysis and reconstruction.

Time-varying filtering of audio signals using both frequency-domain processing and traditional FIR filtering.

Analysis of reconstruction errors (SNR) and visualization of filtered signals.

[Subfolder README provides detailed instructions for usage.]

Usage

Navigate to the subfolder of the exercise you want to run.

Open the main script (main.m) and ensure the audio file paths are correct for your system.

Run the script in MATLAB to visualize results and listen to audio outputs.
