Overview

This exercise explores Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and time-varying filtering:

STFT analysis of audio signals with various synthesis methods (FBS, WOLA, No Overlap).

Windowing techniques and overlap management for accurate reconstruction.

Filtering in the frequency domain using time-varying filters.

Reconstruction of signals via inverse STFT.

Evaluation of reconstruction quality using SNR and visual comparison.

Instructions

Update the audio file path to match your system.

Run the main.m script in MATLAB.

Examine spectrograms, reconstructed signals, and listen to filtered audio outputs.

Do not run the entire script at once. Execute the code section by section according to your choice, to better observe intermediate results and avoid conflicts.
