Overview

This exercise demonstrates custom audio resampling using polyphase filters. It covers:

Upsampling and downsampling of audio signals.

L-normalized vs. M-normalized output comparison.

Spectral analysis with FFT to verify resampling quality.

Comparison with MATLAB's built-in resample function.

Playback of original and processed signals for auditory inspection.

Instructions

Update the audio file paths to match your system.

Run the main.m script in MATLAB.

Observe the spectral plots and listen to the processed audio.
