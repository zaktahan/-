# Exercise 1: Optical Lens Systems and Ray Tracing

This MATLAB exercise simulates and analyzes various optical lens systems, including:

- Calculation of refractive indices for different materials (BK7, F2) as a function of wavelength.
- S-polarization transmission through thin films.
- ABCD matrix analysis for lens systems.
- Ray tracing through bi-convex and achromatic lenses.
- Visualization of focal lengths and ray propagation.
