# Exercise 2: Diffraction Simulations

This MATLAB exercise explores diffraction patterns using Fresnel and Fraunhofer approximations:

- Creation of circular apertures.
- 2D FFT of aperture function for spectral analysis.
- Fraunhofer diffraction pattern calculations and visualization.
- Fresnel diffraction simulations for different propagation distances.
- Calculation of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) for diffraction patterns.
