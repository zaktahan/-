# Optical Communication Simulations

MATLAB simulations for optical communication, covering pulse propagation in fibers and BER analysis for photodetectors.

## Overview

**Exercise 1:** Pulse propagation
- Gaussian and Sech pulses
- Time/frequency domain analysis
- Pulse broadening and maximum bit rate
- Multi-bit sequences

**Exercise 2:** Detector BER
- PIN and Avalanche photodiodes
- BER vs received power
- Thermal and shot noise simulation
- Histograms of detector currents
